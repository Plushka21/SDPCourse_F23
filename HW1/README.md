## Description
This is a project that aims to create tinder analogue for sport. This app provides functionality of creating a personal account, organizing own sport activites or choosing from activities created by other users.

## Manual
To run this app simply run **main.py** in any convenient way either in terminal or IDE. The program will ask you if you want to load prerecorded users and their activities ot you want to have blank app with no data inside.

After that you can
1. Create new user with unique name.
2. Choose user from existing (*i.e.*, switch accounts)
3. Create new activity of from the lsit of possible activities, specify start time for this activity and location
4. Choose activity created by other users
5. See the list of activities created by the current user

## Extensions
As for extensions users may add more different activities to the lsit of possible activities by adding them in *data/activities_list.txt* file. Moreover, it would be more convenient to have a **GUI** that also can be done on the base of the existing app. All of these are left for the future work.
